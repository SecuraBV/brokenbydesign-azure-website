            The Story
        </h2>
        <p>
            The company named SuperCompany B.V. has been working with IT systems for a while now and have an IT team of
            a
            whoppin' 2 people. Because the CEO of the company has heard that 'Cloud' is the new way of working, the CEO
            has
            asked the IT team to migrate all IT systems to the Azure cloud platform. Sadly, management does not allow
            the IT
            team to take courses or trainings to learn more about Azure cloud and so they have to learn as-they-go.

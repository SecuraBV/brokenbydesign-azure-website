            The <strong>PEM</strong> file can be used to authenticate with the Azure CLI. Multiple things are in this
            <strong>PEM</strong> file, the public certificate and the private key.
            In this case, the file also seems to contain some comments for the developers. These are the app-id and
            tenant-id.

            It is possible to authenticate using the <strong>az login --service-principal -u <app-id> -p
                    SECURA{C3RT1F1C3T3}.pem --tenant 4452edfd-a89d-43aa-8b46-a314c219cc50
                    --allow-no-subscriptions</strong>
            command.
            Once logged in, the application does not seem to have any access to any Azure resources. But it does have
            access
            to some basic Active directory information.
            To list all users in the Azure Active Directory, you can use the command <strong>az ad user list</strong>.
            Scrolling through the information there seems to be a comment
            on the account of the DevOps engineers. The comment contains a password. The password is
            <strong>SECURA{D4F4ULT_P4SSW0RD}</strong>.

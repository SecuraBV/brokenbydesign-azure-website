            Azure has a couple of ways to protect secret information like passwords and connection strings like Key
            Vaults,
            Connection String configurations, Function keys and many more.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sadly, one of the most common issues found in security audits, is that these features are not used or not
            used
            correctly. In this case, the IT team did not know these features existed. Because they did not expect anyone
            to
            be able to login to the DevOps account, they decided to just have secrets in the source code of the Azure
            Function.

            The connection string contains a password. This password (and also the flag) is
            <strong>SECURA{C0NN3CT10N_STR1NG}</strong>.

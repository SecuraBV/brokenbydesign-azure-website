            The website has not been migrated to the new cloud environment yet. But the IT team did already migrate all
            the
            files.
        </p>
        <p>
            One of the migrated files is the logo of this website. Because everyone has to be able to see the logo, the
            IT
            team decided to make the storage container (where the file is saved) publicly available.
        </p>
        <p>
            What they forgot is that they host ALL their files in this storage container, meaning all the files are now
            accessible for anyone to see. To list all the files, we first need to get the URL of the logo on the
            website.
            After getting the URL, we can remove the name of the image. This is the URL for the Azure container which it
            is
            hosted on. An attacker can use tools (like Azure Storage explorer) to list all files that are in the
            container
            using this URL.
        </p>
        <p>
            One of the files that is now publicly accessible is a <strong>PEM</strong> file. This file contains a public
            key,
            private key and some other information. The name of the file is <strong>SECURA{C3RT1F1C3T3}</strong>, so
            this is
            the
            first flag!
